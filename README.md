# Emery Berger

Professor, Computer Science, Univ. of Massachusetts Amherst. My students, collaborators, and I in the [PLASMA](https://plasma-umass.org) lab build innovative and impactful systems, especially focused on performance, reliability, and security. Among other things, I am also the creator/maintainer of https://CSrankings.org.

## Bio

Emery Berger is a Professor in the [Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://cics.umass.edu) at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), the flagship campus of the UMass system. He graduated with a [Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/455) from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/) in 2002. Professor Berger has been a Visiting Scientist at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research) and at the [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)](https://www.ac.upc.edu/en) / [Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)](https://bsc.es/).

Professor Berger’s research spans programming languages, runtime systems, and operating systems, with a particular focus on systems that transparently improve reliability, security, and performance. He and his collaborators have created a number of influential software systems including [Hoard](https://github.com/emeryberger/Hoard), a fast and scalable memory manager that accelerates multithreaded applications (used by companies including British Telecom, Cisco, Crédit Suisse, Reuters, Royal Bank of Canada, SAP, and Tata, and [on which the Mac OS X memory manager is based](http://emeryblogger.wordpress.com/2010/10/26/im-a-mac-or-emery-inside/)); [DieHard](https://github.com/emeryberger/DieHard), an error-avoiding memory manager that [directly influenced the design of the Windows 7 Fault-Tolerant Heap](http://emeryblogger.wordpress.com/2010/04/06/winning-the-war-on-bugs/); and DieHarder, a secure memory manager that was an inspiration for hardening changes made to the Windows 8 heap (see this map of the [landscape of memory management research](https://github.com/plasma-umass/memory-landscape) for an overview). He also created and maintains the widely-used [CSrankings](https://csrankings.org) website.

His honors include a Microsoft Research Fellowship, an [NSF CAREER Award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0347339), a Lilly Teaching Fellowship, the [Distinguished Artifact Award for PLDI 2014](http://pldi14-aec.cs.brown.edu/), the [Most Influential Paper Award at OOPSLA 2012](http://sigplan.org/Awards/OOPSLA/), the [Most Influential Paper Award at PLDI 2016](http://www.sigplan.org/Awards/PLDI/), the [ASPLOS 2019 Influential Paper Award](https://www.sigops.org/2019/asplos-influential-paper-2019-winner/), [**five** SIGPLAN Research Highlights](https://www.sigplan.org/Highlights/Papers/), **five** CACM Research Highlights ([1](https://doi.org/10.1145/1409360.1409382), [2](https://doi.org/10.1145/2927928), [3](https://doi.org/10.1145/3205911), [4](https://doi.org/10.1145/3422598), [5](https://doi.org/10.1145/3474385)), a Google Research Award, a Microsoft SEIF Award, and Best Paper Awards at [FAST](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast-07/tfs-transparent-file-system-contributory-storage), [OOPSLA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2660193.2660206), and [SOSP](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2815400.2815409). Professor Berger served two terms as an elected member of the SIGPLAN Executive Committee; he served for a decade (2007-2017) as Associate Editor of the ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, was [Program Chair for PLDI 2016](https://pldi16.sigplan.org/committee/pldi-2016-program-committee), and served as [co-Program Chair of ASPLOS 2021](https://asplos-conference.org/2021/index.html%3Fp=44.html). He was named an [ACM Fellow in 2019](https://awards.acm.org/award_winners/berger_4417531).
