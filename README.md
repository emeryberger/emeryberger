# Emery Berger

Professor, Computer Science, Univ. of Massachusetts Amherst. My students, collaborators, and I in the [PLASMA](https://plasma-umass.org) lab build innovative and impactful systems, especially focused on performance, reliability, and security. Among other things, I am also the creator/maintainer of https://CSrankings.org.

## Bio

Emery Berger is a Professor in the [Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://cics.umass.edu) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the flagship campus of the UMass system. He graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin in 2002. Professor Berger has been a Visiting Scientist at Microsoft Research and at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) / Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). Professor Berger’s research spans programming languages, runtime systems, and operating systems, with a particular focus on systems that transparently improve reliability, security, and performance. He and his collaborators have created a number of influential software systems including [Hoard](https://github.com/emeryberger/Hoard), a fast and scalable memory manager that accelerates multithreaded applications (used by companies including British Telecom, Cisco, Crédit Suisse, Reuters, Royal Bank of Canada, SAP, and Tata, and on which the Mac OS X memory manager is based); [DieHard](https://github.com/emeryberger/DieHard), an error-avoiding memory manager that directly influenced the design of the Windows 7 Fault-Tolerant Heap; and DieHarder, a secure memory manager that was an inspiration for hardening changes made to the Windows 8 heap (see this map of the landscape of memory management research for an overview). He also created and maintains the widely-used [CSrankings](https://csrankings.org) website.

His honors include a Microsoft Research Fellowship, an NSF CAREER Award, a Lilly Teaching Fellowship, the Distinguished Artifact Award for PLDI 2014, the Most Influential Paper Award at OOPSLA 2012, the Most Influential Paper Award at PLDI 2016, the ASPLOS 2019 Influential Paper Award, five CACM Research Highlights ([1](https://doi.org/10.1145/1409360.1409382), [2](https://doi.org/10.1145/2927928), [3](https://doi.org/10.1145/3205911), [4](https://doi.org/10.1145/3422598), [5](https://doi.org/10.1145/3474385)), a Google Research Award, a Microsoft SEIF Award, and Best Paper Awards at FAST, OOPSLA, and SOSP; he was named an ACM Fellow in 2019. Professor Berger served two terms as an elected member of the SIGPLAN Executive Committee; he served for a decade (2007-2017) as Associate Editor of the ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, was Program Chair for PLDI 2016, and served as co-Program Chair of ASPLOS 2021.
